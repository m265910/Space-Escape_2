# Space-Escape_2
In Space Escape, you and a partner will play as two spaceships looking to evade enemy spaceships and planets to escape the galaxy. 
Both players will be able to shoot projectile lasers to eliminate targets, as multiple waves of enemies of increasing difficulty enter the screen.
If both players can outlast the timer in the bottom left of the screen without losing all of their lives, then they will escape the galaxy and win the game.
